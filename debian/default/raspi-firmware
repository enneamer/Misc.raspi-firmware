# CMA (Contiguous Memory Allocator) pool size - Defaults to 64M.  Uses
# such as the vc4 video driver might benefit from larger assignations
# (128M), but at a performance cost for the rest of the system
#
# https://people.freedesktop.org/~narmstrong/meson_drm_doc/gpu/vc4.html
#
# Note that setting the CMA is not necessary in RPi4 (specifying it
# might render your system unbootable!)

#CMA=64M

# Filesystem to mount on root. If not specified, find what partition
# is mounted as the root using 'findmnt -n --output=source /'; if none
# is reported, fall back to the Raspberry's most usual /dev/mmcblk0p2.
# but you can specify otherwise, including booting by partition label
# (i.e. ROOTPART="LABEL=root")
#
#ROOTPART=/dev/mmcblk0p2

# Main baremetal application that is started by the firmware once the
# hardware has been initialized. Usually, this is the Linux kernel but
# this can also be u-boot or barebox launched as a second level
# bootloader. Possibles values are "auto", so the kernel image will be
# autodetected from /boot and started directly by the firmware, or the
# name of the image to use from /boot/firmware
#
#KERNEL="auto"

# Pass initramfs address as parameter of the KERNEL image.
# If you don't intend to pass an initramfs to the image started by the
# firmware, simply because you have a custom kernel that ships an
# initramfs or because it will be handled by a second level bootloader
# (like u-boot), set it to "no". Possibles values are "auto", so the
# initramfs image will be autodetected from /boot and pass as parameter
# of the KERNEL image. It can also be set to "no", in this case no
# initramfs will be handled at all by the firmware.
#
#INITRAMFS="auto"

# Consoles to use for logging. This is a list separated by spaces.
# A tty will be put on all consoles contained in this list, but the last
# one will be used for system boot logs and for emergency shell. If you want
# to use the default consoles recommended for the RPIs, leave this value to
# "auto".
# Examples:
# - for logging to an HDMI screen:
#   CONSOLES="tty0"
# - for logging to an uart:
#   CONSOLES="ttyS1,115200"
# - for logging system boot logs to uart and get a console on the HDMI
#   screen and on the uart:
#   CONSOLES="tty0 ttyS1,115200"
#
#CONSOLES="auto"

# Create a file "/etc/default/raspi-firmware-custom" to add custom parameter
# to startup the kernel. Maybe not all options are supported.
# (see https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/)
